                <p><meta content="Value:  $44.00      Size:  3 ct, Full Size      What It Does:  This set includes three OLEHENRIKSEN essentials to help you achieve your smoothest skin ever. The Glow2OH™ Dark Spot Toner is formulated with witch hazel water to help brighten and refine your skin, while the Lemonade Smoothing Scrub™ is made with ultra-fine sugar exfoliants and lemon peel extract that help to exfoliate and polish your skin. The Dewtopia™ 20% Acid Night Treatment helps exfoliate and even out your skin tone and texture thanks to being formulated with 10% AHAs (glycolic and lactic acids) and 10% PHAs (gluconolactone and gluconic acids).      How to Use It:  If you’re new to skincare acids, start using these products slowly, one at a time and once per week. To use the toner, pour it onto a cotton pad at night and swipe it over your clean, dry face in a circular motion. To use the scrub, gently massage it into your wet skin, leave it on for up to two minutes and then rinse, or rinse right away. Use it two to three times per week. To use Dewtopia™, spread it across your face and night before bed.       About the Brand:  OLEHENRIKSEN started as a spa brand, and their products stay true to that heritage today (aka they make you feel as good as you look!)." name="description"/></p>
