                <p><meta content="Value:  $35  Size:  50 ml, Full Size  Product Type:  Hair Oil  What It Does:  Has your hair seen better days? Show your strands what they’re made of with this restorative hair and scalp oil. It combines rosemary oil and the brand’s bond complex to help combat frizz, nourish your scalp, and repair damage to help leave your hair looking and feeling its best.  How to Use It:  To use as a pre-wash treatment, massage three to four dropper fulls of the oil directly into your scalp and work it through the ends of your strands. Leave it on for anywhere between ten minutes to an hour before washing it out. To use on dry hair, warm one to three drops of the oil in your hands and smooth it over your ends.   About the Brand:  AAVRANI was created to blend the two worlds of founder Rooshy Roy: clinically proven, modern day ingredients and ancient, all-natural rituals." name="description"/></p>
